BXDrone
=======
BXDrone is a project that aims to develop a flight controller using an Arduino or Arduino-compatible  board, which would be aboard a quadcopter and will be receiving telecommands and sending telemetry to and from a computer. The Arduino board will use an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to determine the pitch, roll and yaw angles and keep them on a desired value. The communication is intented to be wireless through XBee modules. However, for testing, a wired-serial communication through USB can be done.

While most of the projects suggest to buy a flight controller and build a drone with it, the objective of this project is to get a deep insight on how the flight controller works, which problems can generate and how to solve them.
